CHAT APP 

This is a simple chat app using Express.JS, Socket.io, HTML, CSS.

User logs in with his/her name and chat away in this single room chat place using the link.

User leaves the chat and gets disconnected by closing his/her window

Some issues:

1) The name of the current user in room becomes undefined when a new user comes in

2) Chat lines bleed past the text box after so many exchanges of text. Possible fix is scrolling

3) Fix the maximum length of text

4) Add additional color and other styling

Future plans:

1) Build a database for users and chats (MongoDB?)

2) Require login and password 

3) Chime to notify current users of arrival of new user.
