##CHAT APP

This is a practice for a simple chat app using Express.JS, Socket.io, HTML, CSS.

User logs in with his/her name and chat away in this single room chat place using the link.

User leaves the chat and gets disconnected by closing his/her window

Future plans:

1) Build a database for users and chats

2) Require login and password

3) Chime to notify current users of arrival of new user.
